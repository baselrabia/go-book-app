# Golang rest api üíª

## Task üìù

1. Create a simple Golang application that will serve a RESTful API with a resource (books). The endpoints should support Create, Read, Update and Delete operations.
2. The data should be persisted in a database like SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
3. Add tests for you REST API.
4. Create a dockerfile for your application.

## Tips üßû

### Application example

_Endpoints:_

```sh
# Get all books
GET /books

# Get a specific book
GET /books/:id

# Create a book
POST /books

# Update a book
PUT /books/:id

# Delete a book
DELETE /books/:id
```

_Model:_

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Alchemist",
    "author": "Paulo Coelho",
    "published": 1988
}
```

### Database

This package can be used to connect to a local SQLite database:

If you want an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library, you can use GORM:

-   https://gorm.io/docs/connecting_to_the_database.html#SQLite

### REST API

For creating a HTTP server, you can use echo:

### REST API testing

Documentation for testing echo endpoints:

-   https://echo.labstack.com/guide/testing/

to run test cases 

```bash
go test -v
```

### Repository Pattern 
Repository pattern is a design pattern that we will use in our application. It's basically a way of encapsulating the data access layer logic
In the context of Go and databases, it's common to use repositories in order to abstract away the underlying data source from your business logic.

### Dockerization 
For Create a dockerfile for your application

- https://docs.docker.com/language/golang/build-images/

- https://david-yappeter.medium.com/dockerize-go-application-easily-cf6776d5c05e


To build the docker image run this command in your terminal from root directory of project:
```bash
docker build -t go-restapi .
```
After building the image, you can start it with this command:

```bash
docker run --name restapi -d -p 8080:8080 go-restapi
```
